My Data Science Experiments
A project done by Amal Joy. 

Instruction to operate the file:
1. Data file is taken from the internet so no need of the data file. 
2. Line number 75 is plotting the decision tree in the python screen itself. It requires some additional packages to be installed. In case if you are having trouble installing the packages, just delete that entire chunk. It wonâ€™t effect the running of the program.

Thanks
